# TEMPERATURE-CONTROL-LED
Arduino project: Temperature-Controlled LED using DHT11 sensoR
This is a beginner Arduino project that uses a DHT11 temperature sensor to control an LED.  
The LED turns on/off based on the temperature threshold set in the code.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- DHT11 Sensor
- LED
- Resistor (220Ω)
- Breadboard & Jumper wires
  
## Skills Learned
- Reading sensor data
- Basic conditional logic
- Controlling LEDs
- Working with DHT11
